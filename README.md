## Getting Started

Dowload the repository and open it on Unity3D with versione 2017.4 or newer.

### Prerequisites and Installing

First of all you need to install Unity3D engine on your computer. Then you need a supported smarthphone according with the list provided by Google in the following link: [ARCore Supported Devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices).  
The application was developed only for the [SDK ARCore Preview 2](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases/tag/sdk-preview2), in order to run the application on your smarthphone you need to download and compile the corresponding SDK.
Remember that for the Preview 2 version the list of supported deveices was smaller so It's possible that could not work on your device even if is on the current list.
